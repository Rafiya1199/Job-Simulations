# Project 1: AWS APAC's Solutions Architecture Job Simulation

I completed AWS APAC's Solutions Architecture on Forage. In the simulation I:

1. Designed a simple and scalable hosting architecture based on Elastic Beanstalk for a client experiencing significant growth and slow response
 times.
2. Described my proposed architecture in plain language ensuring my client understood how it works and how costs will be calculated for it.

# Project 2: Verizon Cloud Platform Job Simulation

I completed Verizon Cloud Platform Job Simulation Program on Forage. In the simulation I:

 * I built a hypothetical new VPN product for Verizon’s Cloud Computing team.
 * Used command line Python to test whether Verizon’s VPN met the cloud-native traits, i.e. redundancy, resiliency and least-privilege.
 * Researched approaches to achieve application security and communicated insights in a PowerPoint Presentation.
