# Project 1: AWS APAC's Solutions Architecture Job Simulation

I completed AWS APAC's Solutions Architecture on Forage. In the simulation I:

1. Designed a simple and scalable hosting architecture based on Elastic Beanstalk for a client experiencing significant growth and slow response
 times.
2. Described my proposed architecture in plain language ensuring my client understood how it works and how costs will be calculated for it.
